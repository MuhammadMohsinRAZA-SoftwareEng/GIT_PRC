        since the 1500s when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

        is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
        using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
        look like readable.
